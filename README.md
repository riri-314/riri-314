## About me

I’m currently completing my **Master’s degree in Computer Science** at **UCLouvain**, with **only my thesis left** before graduating in **June 2026**.  
I’m actively seeking a **first professional experience** and I’m **available to start before obtaining my diploma**.

My interests span **cybersecurity**, **networking**, and **front-end / full-stack development**. I’m a fast learner, curious by nature, and I enjoy turning ideas into reliable, well-documented systems.

## What I do

- 🔐 **Cybersecurity & Networking:** security fundamentals, network services, hardening, analysis mindset  
- 🧩 **Full-stack projects:** building websites, automation tools, inventory & order management systems  
- 🧠 **Soft skills:** team coordination, event organization, partner communication, budgets & priorities  

I enjoy collaborating with others, but I’m also fully comfortable working independently and owning deliverables end-to-end.
