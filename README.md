## About me

I’m currently completing my **Master’s degree in Computer Science** at **UCLouvain**, with **only my thesis left** before graduating in **June 2026**.  
I’m actively seeking a **first professional experience** and I’m **available to start before obtaining my diploma**.

My interests span **cybersecurity**, **networking**, and **front-end / full-stack development**. I’m a fast learner, curious by nature, and I enjoy turning ideas into reliable, well-documented systems.

## What I do

- 🔐 **Cybersecurity & Networking:** security fundamentals, network services, hardening, analysis mindset  
- 🧩 **Full-stack projects:** building websites, automation tools, inventory & order management systems  
- 🧠 **Soft skills:** team coordination, event organization, partner communication, budgets & priorities  

I enjoy collaborating with others, but I’m also fully comfortable working independently and owning deliverables end-to-end.

## 🌐 Student quizz
This is a web app that provides quizzes for students. The goal of the website is to teach students how to party responsibly, with respect for themselves and others. It mainly covers sexual education and safe drinking. I was paid to develop this website.

## 🍻 Mercatos GCL
This web app is a game designed for student associations. Its purpose is to encourage exchanges between associations so students can better discover each other and build connections. It is a fun game created to strengthen bonds between different student associations across various fields of study.

I built this website using React and TypeScript. For the backend, I used Firebase services, including Cloud Functions, Hosting, and Firestore.
